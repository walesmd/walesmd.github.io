    <p>I recently read Rob Conery&#39;s <em><a href="http://www.wekeroad.com/2014/02/18/i-had-a-choice-php-or-net/">PHP or ASP.NET: Did I Do The Right Thing?</a></em> Although it does a great job uncovering how a developer can literally lose half a decade of their life by focusing their efforts towards the wrong technologies, I can&#39;t help but feel as if Rob is still asking himself the wrong questions, focusing on symptoms rather than the problem itself.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the article Rob imagines five ways his professional life would be better today, had he not focused on ASP.NET (presumably, if he had focused on PHP):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Know Linux a whole lot better</li>
<li>Be very familiar with MySQL and other open databases</li>
<li>Be less scared of JavaScript than I was 4 years ago</li>
<li>Be less reliant on an IDE</li>
<li>Love HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Let that sink in for a moment... here we have a Web Developer that is/was scared of JavaScript, doesn&#39;t enjoy HTML or CSS, is unfamiliar with open source databases and is arguably uncomfortable with Linux. <strong>These are the very foundations upon which the web was built!</strong></p>
<p>By no means are my intentions to pick on Rob - I don&#39;t know him personally, nor am I familiar with his work; rather, I look to him as an example (and I believe this was his intent with his article).</p>
<p><strong>The framework doesn&#39;t matter.</strong> Whether it&#39;s PHP, Rails, ASP.NET or NodeJS - these are just proxies by which you write software for the web and the languages of the web are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you&#39;re not comfortable, I dare say in <em>love</em> with these three languages, you&#39;re not a Web Developer.</p>
<p>By all means, you may be the best PHP developer the world has ever known; you&#39;ll find a job in which you are a mentor to those that work with you, you&#39;ll live comfortably and you&#39;ll love the work that you&#39;re doing. But, if there&#39;s one fact within the world of web development it is this: frameworks/languages, which are nothing more than varying syntaxes to achieve the same result, come and go.</p>
<p>In a few years, your product will be forced to evolve as the industry continues to evolve. As history has shown us, this more than likely will lead to a new languge or framework, a new way of thinking; the only constant within this vicious cycle are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As you&#39;re packing up your belongings into a box you&#39;ll look back at the remainder of your team, the <strong>Web Developers</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re just starting out, or perhaps you describe yourself as one of these <strong>silo developers</strong> - only focused on a single technology - I encourage you to focus on the basics. Learn web development, first; then, feel free to explore various supporting languages.</p>
<p>Consider this: would you trust a surgeon or specialist, knowing they completely ignored the foundation of general medicine?</p>
